If the markets do well tomorrow, here's a couple stock picks I like: BA (Boeing) and KR (Kinder Morgan Management).

- Their 10 MA's are above their 30 EMA's (uptrend)
- They're above their 200 MA's and it's rising (uptrend)
- 3 consecutive down days of lower highs (slight pullback)
- They are oversold, based on RSI 3 (ready to pop)

Look at the far right candle sticks of the following two charts to see what I'm talking about.
