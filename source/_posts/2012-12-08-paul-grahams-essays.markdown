Paul Graham has a ton of great essays on his [website](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) to do with startups, programming, and being an entrepreneur. I've read quite a few of them in the past and they're all really insightful and give great advice.

The latest one I read was [Holding a Program in One's Head](http://paulgraham.com/head.html). It gives some awesome advice for programmers.
