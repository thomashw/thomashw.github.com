One year ago today, Steve Jobs resigned as CEO of Apple.

One of my favourite keynotes to watch is the original introduction of the iPhone. Right around the 29 minute mark gives me chills. You can download it on iTunes and I think you should, even if you don't want to watch it right away. It's an iconic event and it would be a shame to not have it if it's ever taken off of iTunes.

Download it [here](http://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/apple-keynotes/id275834665).

His keynotes were special. I'll miss them.
